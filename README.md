Playing around with Firefox extensions

# What it does?
Automatically detects the channel whose video is playing and if it is "GAMEATTACK" then like that video. 

## Status
The page loaded call back works fine for the new material firefox but there is no way to check if the page has loaded completely in classic YT. So halting until YT completely changes to material
